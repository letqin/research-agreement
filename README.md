# KSP Ship database

This is a place to store KSP ship files in a remote location. In each folder there are VAB and SPH folders with rockets and planes respectively. The [Charflorpus Gangreeno](/charflorpus-gangreeno) folder is from Quinn's research save, these ships contain some mods (listed at the bottom of the README).
